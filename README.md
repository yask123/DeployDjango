# DeployDjango

### Safely deploy your Django app in less 1 minute!

Got a cool Django web app running in your local machine?
Wish to take it to the world ASAP, without scratching your head ?

Usage Just run this bash script from the root of your django project in your Ubuntu instance.

```bash
$ sudo ./deploydjango projectname
```

### That’s it, You’r done!


Visit `http://ip-address-of-your-instance` to see your web app live!

Instructions 

### Installing the DeployDjango script 
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yask123/DeployDjango/master/deploydjango.sh
$ chmod +x deploydjango.sh
```

From your Django App’s root directory (Where manage.py file exists).
```bash
./deploydjango.sh project_name
```




Notes:

1. Script works for Ubuntu instance only!
2. Make sure port 80 is open (For your app to be accessible to users after deployment) 

### Behind the scene 

The script would run your django app with gunicorn on port 8000, and would use nginx reverse proxy settings to make your app accessible from port 80. 

###### The script does the following things:

* Install nginx,python-pip, gunicorn.
* Set up the correct nginx configuration for your django app
* Start nginx service on your instance
* Start your app with gunicorn
* Perform tests to verify if deployment was successful (ToDo)
